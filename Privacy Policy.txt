## 3. Data Sharing & Visibility
**3.1 Public Visibility**: Your Profile is visible in Search/Leaderboards unless you toggle "Private Profile" in Settings.

**3.2 Team Visibility**: When you join a Team, members can see your contribution and shared photos.

**3.3 Third Parties**: We do not sell your personal data. We use **MongoDB Atlas** for secure, encrypted cloud storage.

## 4. Data Retention & Deletion
**4.1 Deletion**: You may delete your account via `Settings > Profile > Delete Account`. This permanently wipes your profile and anonymizes historical logs.

## 5. Security
We use industry-standard security measures, including TLS/SSL encryption in transit and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication.
